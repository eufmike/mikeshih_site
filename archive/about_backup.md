## Hi
I am **Mike C.C. Shih**, an imaging data scientist, a husband, a father, and a euphonium enthusiast. I am originally from Taiwan and finished my Ph.D. in the United States. I was trained in *Neuroscience* and graduated with a Ph.D. in *Pharmacology*. I am currently doing imaging data science and live in St. Louis.<!--more-->  

In my current position, I have been afforded unique opportunities to develop and integrate modern image processing methodologies to the sector of data analysis in our Center, including initiating a project focused on deep-learning based target detection. These projects have allowed me to drastically expand my capabilities in statistical inference, machine learning development and model fine-tuning, along with data-driven image acquisition. 

Through my management, these projects have delivered substantial insight into scientific research and supported biomedical research, grant application, and publications with state-of-the-art technologies. I would like to share some of my contributions with you on this website.
