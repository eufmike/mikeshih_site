## Hi
I am **Mike Shih**, an imaging data scientist, a husband, a father, and a euphonium enthusiast. I am originally from Taiwan and finished my Ph.D. in the United States. I was trained in *Neuroscience* and graduated with a Ph.D. in *Pharmacology*. I am currently doing imaging data science and live in St. Louis.<!--more-->  

## How did I start programming? 
My journey of programming started during my Ph.D. I wrote an ImageJ Macro to read PCR gels and manage CSV files with R, so I don't have to take notes manually. It really did't saved too much time, but it gave me a chance to peek behind how data handling and imaging processing work. 

I was totally amazed. Especially from the perspective of a wet lab scientist, being able to be automatic means methods can be scaled up. A very simple truth: scaling up means less chance of misinterpretation. I started searching and learning about data science, and realized data science is far more than that. Years later, I joined a cellular imaging facility and applied most of data science skill to my daily job: data handling/wrangling, visualization, cleaning, image processing, everything. Today, I am performing segmentation with Convolutional Neural Networks, prototyping with Python and TensorFlow.

This is how I gained my experiences. Part of me is still a neuroscientist, but I heartfully believe that data science and computer vision are the future. They are fascinating purely by their nature, which makes me want to keep exploring them. 

## Why do I make this website? 

Mostly selfish reasons, I guess. I hope people know me better when they read my mixed background; I also need to give myself a reason to keep tracking the development of data science over time. 

Another reason is for documentation: not all the projects I involved have their chances to get published. It is very easy to forget what I did. Writing them down is a good idea and maybe someone will find them helpful or interesting in the future. 

## Anything else? 
I speak natively in Mandarin and Taiwanese. 

I am a hardcore fan of British-style Brass Band. My beloved euphonium is Besson Prestige 2052, with Denis Wick mouthpiece SM4XR.
