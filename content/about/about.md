I am Mike Shih, an imaging data scientist, a husband, a father, and a euphonium enthusiast.  I was trained as a neuroscientist, graduated with a Ph.D. in Pharmacology, and resorted to imaging data science and microscopy after my Ph.D. training.<!--more--> 

ImageJ and R were the first sets of tools I used for image analysis. I wrote ImageJ macro to read mice genotypes from PCR gels and documented the results with R. Not only saving me tons of time, it also gave me a chance to peek behind the magic of data analysis and imaging. I continued working in this field until I found myself works in a cellular imaging facility using convolutional neural networks to extract information from all kinds of imaging modalities. I spent significant time working on python. I also helped biologists scale up their imaging experiments. 

I consider myself a mix of a biologist and image solution developer with, but not limited to, interests in biological images. Image analysis, overarched by data science and computer vision, is fascinating. It is like a key to the backdoors of all knowledge and worth investing one's whole life on it. 

This website is a space for me to share some thoughts and code. It runs on an excellent open-source framework called Hugo.
