My publications are listed on my Google Scholar [profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DtZcXZsAAAAJ). My coding profile is on [GitHub](https://github.com/eufmike).

I co-authored Chapter 3 of the book **Methods in Extracellular Matrix Biology**, entitled ["Nonlinear optical imaging of extracellular matrix proteins"](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.mcb.2017.08.004). I appreciate the chance and efforts *James Fitzpatrick* and *Robert Mecham* offered.
