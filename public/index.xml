I co-authored Chapter 3 of the book Methods in Extracellular Matrix Biology, entitled &amp;ldquo;Nonlinear optical imaging of extracellular matrix proteins&amp;rdquo;. I appreciate the chance and efforts James Fitzpatrick and Robert Mecham offered.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>/projects/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2020 05:13:10 -0500</pubDate><guid>/projects/</guid><description>DL Segmentation on FIB-SEM Datasets GitHub: DL Segmentation on FIB-SEM Datasets
Features: Python, Keras, TensorFlow
This repository holds code for deep-learning-based image segmentation. The target datasets were 3D cellular images acquired from a Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope (FIB-SEM). The goal is to label cells and their subcellular structures, such as nucleus, mitochondria, etc. These labels can offer medical insights by analyzing their features under different genetic conditions and treatments.</description></item><item><title>Ripley's K Demo: 02 K test</title><link>/posts/2020/04/ripleys-k-demo-02-k-test/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2020 05:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/2020/04/ripleys-k-demo-02-k-test/</guid><description>Use previously generated point process for Ripley&amp;rsquo;s K test The default size of point process generator is 20 x 20 Please visit the code on my GitHub # denpendency import os, sys import scipy.stats import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.style import matplotlib as mpl import spatialstat.ppsim as ppsim import spatialstat.spatialpattern as spatialpattern %load_ext autoreload %autoreload 2 # define IO dir path = &amp;#39;.</description></item><item><title>Ripley's K Demo: 01 Point Process Simulation</title><link>/posts/2020/04/ripleys-k-demo-01-point-process-simulation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2020 05:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>/posts/2020/04/ripleys-k-demo-01-point-process-simulation/</guid><description>Before demonstrating Ripley&amp;rsquo;s K function ($K(t)$), $L(t)$, and $H(t)$), I have to first simulate two types of point process: 1. Poisson point process and 2. Thomas point process. The point process generator is adpated from Connor Johnson&amp;rsquo;s blog post.

One good example is Airyscan. The resolution of Airyscan is slightly lower than SIM, yet, its success rate and stability make it the best bet when it comes to imaging organelle markers (MitoTracker or LysoTracker).
Once image acquisition and labeling are made, to conclude, a certain level of spatial analysis could be necessary.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/about/</guid><description>&lt;figure>

&lt;p>I am &lt;strong>Mike Shih&lt;/strong>, an imaging data scientist, a husband, a father, and a euphonium enthusiast. I am originally from Taiwan and finished my Ph.D. in the United States. I was trained in &lt;em>Neuroscience&lt;/em> and graduated with a Ph.D. in &lt;em>Pharmacology&lt;/em>. I am currently doing imaging data science and live in St. Louis.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
